# Goals

- I will learn Java by following this course https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java starting on 07/26/2022.

- I will finish the course linked above by 07/27/2022.

- I will eat chicken for lunch during lunch break.

# Expectations

- If something in the course is confusing, then I will google that thing to find more examples

- If I’m stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes, then I will get up and take a walk for a couple
  minutes to clear my head

- If I really have to go to the bathroom but don’t want to stop working because I’m in the zone and
  knocking out some awesome code, then I will first commit my code, then go to the bathroom, because
  personal health is important!
